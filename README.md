### A Toast in Android is a small, non-interactive pop-up message used to show brief feedback to the user. 
### It appears on the screen for a short duration and automatically disappears. 
### Toasts are typically used for status messages like "Saved" or "No Internet Connection." 
### They don’t block user input and require no user interaction. You can customize a toast’s layout, duration, and screen position.
